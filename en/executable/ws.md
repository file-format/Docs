## What is a WS file?

A **.WS file** on Windows typically holds executable script designed to be executed through **Windows Script Host**. This script can encompass diverse elements and routines such as JScript and VBScript routines as well as XML elements. Upon double-clicking a ".ws" file, the Windows Script Host will initiate the execution of the script embedded within the file.

## About Windows Host Script

Windows Script Host (WSH) is scripting host developed by Microsoft that allows users to run scripts written in scripting languages such as VBScript (Visual Basic Scripting Edition) and JScript (Microsoft's version of JavaScript); it provides framework for scripting in Windows operating system, enabling automation of various tasks and system administration.

Here are some key points about Windows Script Host:

1.  **Scripting Languages:** WSH supports multiple scripting languages, with VBScript and JScript being the most commonly used; scripts can be written in either of these languages to automate tasks, interact with the operating system or manipulate data.
    
2.  **Script Execution:** WSH scripts are typically stored in files with extensions like ".vbs" for VBScript or ".js" for JScript; when you run a script, WSH interprets and executes the code.
    
3.  **Automation:** WSH is often used for automation purposes such as automating repetitive tasks, managing system settings and performing administrative functions; is particularly useful for system administrators and power users.
    
4.  **Console and GUI Scripts:** WSH scripts can be either console-based or GUI-based; console scripts run in a command-line window while GUI scripts can create graphical user interfaces for more interactive applications.
    
5.  **Security:** WSH has security features to help prevent malicious scripts from causing harm; users are typically prompted before executing scripts and scripts are subject to certain restrictions to prevent unauthorized access and actions.
    
6.  **Windows Script Host Object Model:** WSH provides an object model that allows scripts to interact with the Windows operating system; this includes access to file systems, registry settings, network resources and other system components.
    
7.  **Script Execution from Command Line:** You can execute WSH scripts from the command line by using the `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe` executables, depending on whether you want to run the script in a console or GUI environment.

## How to open WS file?

WS files are plain text files, so if you want to open or edit them, you can use any text editor e.g.

- **Notepad**
- **Notepad++**
- **Apple TextEdit**
- **Visual Studio Code**

Please note if you want to run the script inside WS file, you can simply double click it or use the `wscript` command on command line.
