The M2TS uses variable rate (VBR) Transport Streams instead of the typical constant rates (CBR) found in MPEG-2 TS broadcast  for optimizing the storage size. A T-STD compliant constant rate Transport Stream for playback the arrival timestamp (ATS) of each packet needs to be recorded to be able to reconstruct.
