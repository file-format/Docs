## What is an MXF File?

A file with .mxf extension is a multimedia container format that contains digital video and audio media along with metadata information about the file. It follows the SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) standard that is a global association of professionals from engineering, technology, and executives working in the media and entertainment industry. MXF files can be converted to other file formats such as [AVI](/video/avi/) or [MOV](/video/mov/).

## MXF File Format

MXF files are in fact binary files that consist of a sequence of bytes in a definite format. Decoding applications must compliant with this format in order to understand it and extract information from it. The format allows adding new items without breaking backward compatibility using the KLV coding which is described below.

 * Key – the identifier of the element, an SMPTE Universal Label (UL)
 * Length – the length of the data which is the variable-length encoding used in order to reduce the amount of space required for this item
 * Value – the actual value of the element.

### MXF Structural Metadata

Structural metadata is fundamental in an MXF file as it contains useful information about the contents of the file. MXF metadata contains information such as frame rate, frame size, file creation date, and custom modification date. The structural metadata describes the structure and capabilities of an MXF file that includes technically describing the various essential components and conveying how the output timeline is composed.
