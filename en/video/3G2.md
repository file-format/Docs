## What is a 3G2 file? ##

3G2(3GPP2 file format) is a multimedia container format similar to the [3GP](/video/3gp/) file format. 3G2 is defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) for 3G CDMA2000 multimedia services. 3G2 files are stored with the .3g2 extension. As compared to 3GP files, 3G2 files consume less space and bandwidth.

## Technical Details ##

The 3G2 format is based on the ISO base media file format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 â€“ MPEG-4 Part 12. 3G2 file format was developed for mobile phones to reduce storage, bandwidth, and data usage. 3G2 file format supports the following codecs:

- Video
  - MPEG-4 Part 2
  - H.263
  - MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264)
- Audio
  - AMR-WB
  - AMR-NB
  - AAC-LC
  - HE-AAC v1
  - EVRC
  - EVRC-B
  - EVRC-WB
  - 13K (QCELP)
  - SMV
  - VMR-WB

For the storage of MPEG-4 content, 3G2 refers to the MP4 and AVC specifications, and for the storage of H.263 and AMR content, it refers to the 3GP specifications.
