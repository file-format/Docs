## What is a BDMV file?

A BDMV file is a type of file format used in Blu-ray Disc (BD) video discs. BDMV stands for "Blu-ray Disc Movie" and is a container format used to store high-definition video, audio, and other related content on Blu-ray discs. BDMV files are part of the Blu-ray Disc's directory structure and contain various components of a Blu-ray movie, including video streams, audio tracks, subtitles, and menu structures.

## Key Components of a BDMV Directory:

1. **STREAM folder**: This folder typically contains the video and audio streams of the movie. Video is usually stored in the form of M2TS (MPEG-2 Transport Stream) files, while audio may be in formats like Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio.

2. **CLIPINF folder**: This folder contains information about the individual video clips (M2TS files) on the disc.

3. **PLAYLIST folder**: It contains playlist files that specify the order in which video clips should be played. Blu-ray discs often have multiple playlists for different viewing options or versions of the movie.

4. **AUXDATA folder**: This folder stores auxiliary data and metadata associated with the movie.

5. **BDJO folder**: It contains Java-based interactive menu structures for Blu-ray discs. These menus enable features like scene selection, special features, and more.

6. **JAR folder**: Java Archive files used for interactive menus and special features.

7. **INDEX.BDM and MOVIEOBJ.BDM files**: These files contain information about the disc's structure and navigation.
