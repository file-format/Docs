## What is a DCE file?

DCE file format typically refers to DriveCam Events, which are events recorded by a DriveCam system. DriveCam is a type of in-vehicle video camera system often used in the context of fleet management and driver safety. The system is designed to capture video footage when certain events or behaviors are detected, such as harsh acceleration, sudden braking, sharp turns, or collisions.

When a DriveCam Event (DCE) occurs, the system records video footage leading up to and following the triggering event; this footage can be valuable for assessing driver behavior, improving safety, and investigating incidents; the video data is usually stored in a specific file format known as DCE file format.

## How to open DCE file?

If you have a DCE file from a DriveCam system, you might need specialized software or tools provided by the manufacturer to view and analyze the video content; the specific details about the DCE file format and compatibility can vary depending on the manufacturer and model of the DriveCam system.

You can also convert the DCE file to AVI format and then use AVI player to play the video.
