## What is a TBZ file?

 A file with .tbz extension is a compressed archive that uses BZIP compression for reducing the size of the content files. The TBZ files are actually UNIX [TAR](/compression/tar/) archived files that are compressed with BZIP then. The most recent second level compression is [BZIP2](/compression/bz2/) that replaced BZIP. TBZ file format is suitable for transferring large files. TBZ files can be opened/extracted using software applications such as 7-Zip, PeaZip, and jZip. Linux and macOS users can also open a TBZ with the BZIP2 command from a terminal window.

## TBZ File Format

TBZ files are actually compressed archives created with BZIP/[BZIP2](/compression/bz2/) compression. There are no formal specifications available for this file format. However, an unofficial [reverse engineered specifications](https://github.com/dsnet/compress/blob/master/doc/bzip2-format.pdf) show that a .bz2 stream consists of a 4-byte header which is followed by zero or more compressed blocks.
