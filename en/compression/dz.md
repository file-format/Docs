## What is a DZ file?

A file with .dz extension is a compressed archive created with the command line utility [Dzip](https://speeddemosarchive.com/dzip/). It offers a higher compression ratio than other compression file formats. Dzip can also decompress compressed files and extraction of files is more quicker. Dzip comes with full integration for Windows shell to accept dragged files with the feature to avoid duplication of files when dragged to archive. Like [RAR](/compression/rar/) files, Dzip is able to create self-extracting executable files from its .dz files. The comparatively small size of Dzip utility (130k) makes it possible to carry this utility on disc.

## DZ File Format

DZ is a proprietary file format and its technical details are not available. These are saved as binary files to disc with compressed file size.
