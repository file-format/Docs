## What is an ECS file?

An ECS file is a data backup file created by Sony Ericsson mobile phones. It stores a copy of user's data as backup in case recovery is required for restoring the stored data. ECS files are saved as compressed [ZIP](/compression/zip/) archives to reduce the disc space utilization. This also makes it easy for transferring data over low speed internet connections.
