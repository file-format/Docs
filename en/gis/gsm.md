## What is a GSM file?

A GSM file is a project file created with MapViewer software that is used for spatial analysis and creating geographic maps. It is a map settings file that stores configuration information related to the visualization settings of maps such as text labels, colors, legend, and referenced data files.

## GSM File Format

GSM files are saved in binary file format and its internal file structure details are not available publicly for developer's reference. MapViewer software comes with sample GSM files and some [DAT](/database/dat/) files that are used to create further GSM files.

### About MapViewer

MapViewer lets you work with map files by overlaying your data on geographic areas. This helps in visualizing spatial data such as population density maps, climate maps, and several other types of data.
