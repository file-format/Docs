## What is a MIF file?

A MIF (MapInfo Interchange Format) file is a map file used by MapInfo software that is used for mapping and geographic analysis. It contains GIS elements including areas, curves and points and the associated information with these such as color, thickness, and style. MIF files are used to exchange data between GIS applications.

MIF file format is supported by TatukGIS Viewer and by FME software.

## MIF File Format

MIF file format is a vector file format that is stored as plain ASCII text file. It describes the contents of a MapInfo table that is stored in corresponding **MID** file. MIF is a proprietary file format and its internal file format specifications are not available publicly. However, you can open the file in a basic text editor and read the contents of the file.
