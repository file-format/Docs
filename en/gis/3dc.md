## What is a 3DC file?

A 3DC file is a GPS data file used by the GPS navigation software application, [iGO](https://www.igonavigation.com/). It contains 3D building data information along with metadata for application display. 3DC files are saved to the memory card of the navigation unit and are mostly stored to the \​iGO\​content\​building\​ directory.
