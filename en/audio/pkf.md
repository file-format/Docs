## What is a PKF file?

The PKF file format is commonly associated with Adobe Audition, a professional audio editing software. It stands for "Peak" file, and it is generated by Audition to store information about audio peak levels. This information is used for various purposes, including waveform display, audio editing, and processing.

## PKF File Format - More Information

When you import audio files into Adobe Audition, it analyzes audio and generates corresponding **.pkf files** alongside the original audio files. These .pkf files contain data about maximum peak levels of the audio waveform, allowing Audition to quickly redraw waveform display without repeatedly analyzing audio file.

PKF files are usually stored in the same directory as corresponding audio files and have same filename, with ".pkf" extension appended to it.

The .pkf file format primarily contains metadata related to audio file it corresponds to. This metadata includes information about peak levels, which are the highest amplitude points in audio waveform. 

PKF files are relatively small compared to original audio files because they store metadata rather than actual audio data. They typically only contain necessary information to represent peak levels accurately.

PKF files are automatically generated by Adobe Audition or similar audio editing software when audio files are imported or analyzed within program. The software calculates peak levels of audio waveform and saves this data in the corresponding .pkf file.

## How to open a PKF file?

Since .pkf files are associated with Adobe Audition, the primary way to open them is by using Adobe Audition software. Here is how you can open a .pkf file in Adobe Audition:

1. Open Adobe Audition.
1. Go to "File" > "Open..."
1. Navigate to the location of .pkf file.
1. Select the .pkf file and click "Open."
1. The .pkf file will open in Adobe Audition, allowing you to view and edit associated audio waveform.

PKF files can be opened using the following programs

- **Adobe Audition 2023** 
- **Adobe Premiere Pro 2023**
