## What is APE file?
The APE file is an audio file compressed with **Monkey's Audio**; an algorithm for lossless audio data compression. Unlike lossy compression methods such as AAC, MP3, Vorbis, and Opus, this typical algorithm does not scrap any data during the process of encoding. The files encoded to Monkey's Audio are usually reduced to about half of their original size. These files contain error detection and tag support that save data about the audio files. This file format is more widely used among Microsoft Windows users. It uses highly insistent compression rate and the other great thing is that the Monkey's Audio files can be always decompressed to the exact, original files. The Monkey's Audio encoder is freely available and can be included easily into other software programs. If Monkey's Audio is Compared to [ALAC](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/alac/), [FLAC](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/flac/), or WavPack, it is relatively slow to encode or decode files.
