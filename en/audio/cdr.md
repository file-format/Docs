## What is a CDR file?

A **.CDR** file with **"Raw CD Audio Data"** typically refers to a file containing audio information extracted directly from an audio CD, such as music tracks. "Raw CD Audio Data" refers to the unprocessed digital audio data from a CD, which is often stored in a binary format. This raw data contains the audio samples exactly as they are on the CD, including both audio and subcode information.

These files are not typically meant to be played directly but are instead used for various purposes like CD mastering, audio editing, and CD burning. Software applications for audio editing and CD authoring often use this raw data to create audio CDs or convert it into other audio file formats like WAV or MP3.

If you need to work with .cdr files containing "Raw CD Audio Data," you would typically use specialized audio software to process or convert them, as they are not standard audio files that can be played in most media players.

## How to convert a CDR file?

To convert a .cdr file containing "Raw CD Audio Data" to a more common audio format like WAV or MP3, you'll need specialized software. If you're able to play your .cdr file in the VideoLAN VLC media player, you can also use VLC to convert it to different audio formats e.g.

- [.MP3](/audio/mp3/) - MP3 Audio
- [.FLAC](/audio/flac/) - Free Lossless Audio Codec
- [.WAV](/audio/wav/) - WAVE Audio
- [.OGG](/audio/ogg/) - Ogg Vorbis Audio

## How to open CDR file?

Opening a .cdr file, particularly one containing "Raw CD Audio Data," can be a bit tricky because it is not a standard audio file format. To open and work with such files, you can use specialized software that can handle raw CD audio data. Here is how to do it and some software options:

**Software to Open and Work with .cdr Files:**

1.  **Exact Audio Copy (EAC)**:
    
    -   Download and install Exact Audio Copy, which is a popular and powerful tool for working with audio CDs and extracting "Raw CD Audio Data."
    -   Insert the CD with the .cdr file into your computer's CD/DVD drive.
    -   Open EAC and configure it to your preferences, including the output format (e.g., WAV or MP3).
    -   Use EAC to extract the audio tracks from the CD and save them in the desired format.
2.  **Audacity**:
    
    -   Audacity is a free, open-source audio editing software that can also work with "Raw CD Audio Data."
    -   Insert the CD.
    -   Open Audacity and configure it to record audio from your CD drive.
    -   Record the audio from the CD, and then save it in a more common audio format.
3.  **VLC Media Player**:
    
    -   VLC can play audio directly from CDs, including those with "Raw CD Audio Data."
    -   Insert the CD into your computer.
    -   Open VLC, go to the "Media" menu, and select "Open Disc."
    -   Choose the CD drive and play the audio tracks directly.
4.  **CD Ripper Software**:
    
    -   There are various CD ripper software options available, such as Windows Media Player (for Windows), iTunes (for Mac), and others.
    -   Insert the CD into your computer.
    -   Open your preferred CD ripper software and use it to extract the audio tracks and save them in a common audio format.
5.  **DAEMON Tools** (for .cdr image files):
    
    -   If the .cdr file is an image file created by software like DAEMON Tools, you can mount the image using DAEMON Tools or similar software.
    -   Once the image is mounted, you can access its contents as if it were a physical CD, and play or extract the audio as needed.
