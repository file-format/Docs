## What is a VOC file? ##

The VOC audio files are created by a voice r√©cordee named RCA digital voice recorder. The interviews and lectures are recorded through this device. These files are portable and can be shared through the USB port. The VOC files are compatible with Windows operating systems. These VOC files can be converted into other file formats which are more popular such as [MP3](/audio/mp3/).
 
The data included in these files can be in raw form or container format. These files were used in Disk operating system games. The sound blaster cards were used for audio and these files were used to do so. 


## Brief History ##

This file format was first introduced in the 1990s. These VOC files were specifically designed for the storage of digital audio files. These files were used when sound cards were developed. When more useful and efficient programs like RIFF WAVE were being developed the use of these files became too lesser.

These files were introduced by a technology company in Singapore named Creative technology (also known as Creative labs). With the spread of technology and modern tools and software to access and execute audios and recordings, these files were used rarely.


## Format Specifications ##

In these files, audio information is contained in a 26-byte header. Moreover, a series of subsequent data blocks are also included in it. Data blocks follow the header and every block starts along with a type byte that describes the content. The size of these files is 3 bytes. There are some uncompressed audio formats of these files, for example, [WAV](/audio/wav/) or AU, etc. These files can store various sounds of instruments, music files, and digital audio clips.
