## What is a CCD file?

A CCD file is known as a disk image file created by using CloneCD Control (CCD) format. It consists of control information, such as header data and track location, for a corresponding IMG file. CCD file must be combined with IMG file to create a usable disk image. CloneCD was introduced as a CD and DVD burning application that could be used to make exact copies of video, music, and data discs, without the restrictions of Digital Rights Management (DRM). Typically, inter-related CloneCD files such as IMG, CCD, and SUB files have the same filenames in a project. 

## CCD file format

A CCD file format is a CloneCD text descriptor with the extension .ccd to mark the properties of a CD or DVD image. To burn a CD or DVD the CCD file needs to be combined with an image file. It can also come with a subchannel file. This format can be used directly by a disc emulator or Virtual CloneDrive. Also, the CCD files are capable to be mounted with third-party virtual drives, such as Daemon or Alcohol Tools. CCDISO application is used to convert an ISO9660-compliant CCD file into an [ISO](/compression/iso/) image.

The formats like [CUE](/disc-and-media/cue/),[BIN](/disc-and-media/bin/), [MDS]() [MDF]() formats have a similar structure to the CCD format, containing both a raw disc image along with a descriptor file.
