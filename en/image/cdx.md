## What is a CDX file?

CDX files are created by CorelDRAW, a vector graphics editing program. These files are a compressed version of the .CDR drawing files, which are the main file format used by CorelDRAW. The purpose of creating CDX files is to reduce the amount of storage space required for a drawing.

## About CorelDRAW

CorelDRAW is a popular vector graphics editing program that is part of the CorelDRAW Graphics Suite software package. When you create a drawing in CorelDRAW and save it, the default file format is typically .CDR (CorelDRAW Drawing). However, to make these files more manageable in terms of storage and easier to share, CorelDRAW allows users to save drawings in a compressed format known as CDX (CorelDRAW Compressed File).

The CDX file format serves as a compressed version of the original .CDR file. Compression is a technique used to reduce the size of the file by encoding information more efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for drawings with intricate details and complex graphics, as it helps to minimize the file size without compromising the quality of the visual content.

The main advantage of CDX files is their smaller size, making them ideal for sharing through email or archiving on external storage media where space may be limited. When you need to distribute CorelDRAW drawings but want to keep file sizes manageable, opting for the CDX format can be a practical solution. It allows users to maintain the integrity of their graphical work while facilitating easier file transfer and storage management.
