## What is a BRD file?

A BRD file format is used in electronic design automation (EDA) software for printed circuit board (PCB) design. PCB design software such as Eagle, KiCad, Altium Designer and others utilize this file format for storing layout, connections and other design-related information of a printed circuit board.

A BRD file is a type of CAD file which are digital files used by engineers and designers to create, modify and analyze designs. BRD file is associated with Autodesk EAGLE, which is software application commonly used in electronics industry for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs). Autodesk EAGLE provides tools for both schematic capture (creating visual representation of circuit) and PCB layout (arranging components and routing connections).

BRD file is created using EAGLE Layout Editor, which is component of Autodesk EAGLE software suite. This editor allows users to design layout of PCB, including placing components, routing traces, defining design rules and creating necessary files for manufacturing.

BRD files serve as templates or blueprints for design of electronic circuitry on PCB. Designers use EAGLE and ".brd" files to translate their schematic diagrams into physical layouts that can be manufactured.

.BRD files can be saved in Gerber drill data format. Gerber files are standard format used in PCB manufacturing to describe patterns, layers, and features of PCB design. Saving ".brd" files in this format allows them to be used by computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs, which generate instructions necessary for fabricating PCB.

## BRD File Viewer

There are several software tools available for viewing ".brd" files, allowing users to visualize and inspect PCB layouts created with software like Autodesk EAGLE. 

1.  **Autodesk EAGLE**: If you have access to Autodesk EAGLE, you can simply open ".brd" files directly within software for viewing and editing purposes.
    
2.  **KiCad**: KiCad is an open-source EDA software suite that includes PCB layout editor. It has capability to import and view ".brd" files created with Autodesk EAGLE.
    
3.  **ViewPlot**: ViewPlot is standalone Gerber viewer that supports various PCB file formats, including ".brd". It allows users to view PCB designs without needing original design software.
    
4.  **GC-Prevue**: GC-Prevue is another popular Gerber viewer that can also handle ".brd" files. It provides features for visualizing PCB layouts, measuring distances and inspecting design details.
    
5.  **Gerbv**: Gerbv is an open-source Gerber viewer that supports viewing Gerber files, which can include ".brd" files saved in Gerber format.
    
6.  **Online Viewer Tools**: There are also online tools available that allow you to upload and view ".brd" files directly in your web browser. One such example is "Online Gerber Viewer" by EasyEDA, which supports viewing various PCB file formats including Gerber and ".brd".

## How to open a BRD file?

BRD files which are used in PCB design, can be opened in various PCB design applications. 

-   **Autodesk EAGLE**: This is cross-platform PCB design software developed by Autodesk. It supports creation of schematic diagrams, PCB layouts, and routing of electrical connections. Users can open ".brd" files directly within Autodesk EAGLE for viewing and further editing.
    
-   **Altium Designer**: Altium Designer is comprehensive PCB design software primarily for Windows operating systems. It offers wide range of features for schematic capture, PCB layout, and design analysis. Altium Designer also supports opening ".brd" files, allowing users to import and work with designs created in other software.
    
-   **Open Board Viewer**: Open Board Viewer is a PCB viewing software specifically designed for Linux operating systems. It is an open-source tool that allows users to visualize PCB layouts, inspect components, and review routing details. Open Board Viewer supports opening ".brd" files, enabling users on Linux platforms to view and analyze designs created in other software.

Here are the list of programs that you can use to open BRD files.

- **Autodesk EAGLE** (Free Trial) for (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Altium Designer** (Free Trial) for (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Open Board Viewer** (Free) for Linux
