## What is a CDX file?

A CDX file is like a special list that keeps track of information in a database. It is used by a program called Microsoft Visual FoxPro, which helps manage data on computer.

There are two types of CDX files:

1. **Structural CDX file:** A Structural CDX file is a specialized file used in conjunction with Microsoft Visual FoxPro, a database management program. This type of CDX file plays crucial role in efficiently organizing and managing data within database. One of its distinctive features is its automatic handling by Visual FoxPro – it opens and maintains itself seamlessly whenever associated database is accessed. Moreover, Structural CDX file necessitates exclusive access to database, meaning only one user can work with it at a time. The file contains an index, serving as streamlined guide for quick data retrieval, enhancing overall efficiency of accessing and manipulating information. Essentially, Structural CDX file ensures that database's data is well-organized and can be efficiently retrieved when needed, making it an integral component for users of Microsoft Visual FoxPro.

2. **Non-structural CDX file:** This type of file does not open automatically when you check database and it is not maintained by Visual FoxPro when new information is added. However, it does not need exclusive access, so multiple people can use it at same time.

## About Fox Pro

Visual FoxPro, abbreviated as VFP, was a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It played prominent role in landscape of desktop database applications. Belonging to xBase family of programming languages, Visual FoxPro shared similarities with other systems like dBase, FoxBase, and Clipper. One of its primary functions was to facilitate creation and management of databases, providing users with tools to efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data.

Beyond its role as database management system, Visual FoxPro featured its own programming language. This language combined elements of procedural and object-oriented programming, enabling developers to craft custom applications with graphical user interfaces. Notably, Visual FoxPro was recognized for its Rapid Application Development (RAD) capabilities, allowing developers to swiftly build robust applications, particularly those centered around data-centric functionalities.

However, despite its popularity, Microsoft officially discontinued Visual FoxPro in 2007. Following this decision, no new versions or updates were released, leading many users to transition to alternative database systems and development platforms. While Visual FoxPro is no longer actively developed or supported by Microsoft, its legacy persists in some existing applications. Developers who were familiar with Visual FoxPro often underwent transitions to other technologies as industry evolved beyond its discontinued status.

## How to open CDX file?

Microsoft Visual FoxPro is one of the software applications capable of opening CDX files.
