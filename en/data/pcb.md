## What is a PCB file?

A PCB file format typically have .pcb extension and is related to Printed Circuit Board (PCB) file. PCBs are essential components in electronic devices, providing a physical platform for connecting various electronic components. PCB files store information about layout, connections, and other design specifications of a printed circuit board.

Here are a few common types of PCB files:

1.  **Gerber Files (.gbr):** These files contain information about different layers of PCB, such as copper traces, solder mask, and silkscreen; Gerber files are the standard format used for manufacturing PCBs.
    
2.  **Excellon Drill Files (.drl):** These files specify locations and sizes of holes to be drilled on PCB. They work in conjunction with Gerber files to provide a complete manufacturing package.
    
3.  **PCB Design Files:** Many PCB design software tools save projects or designs with .pcb extension. Examples include Altium Designer, Eagle, KiCad, and others. These files contain information about placement of components, routing of traces, and other design details.

## How to open PCB file?

PCB files can be opened using the following programs

- **Altium Designer**
- **Autodesk EAGLE**
- **KiCad**
