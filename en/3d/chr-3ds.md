## What is a CHR file?

CHR file format is associated with **3ds Max**, a powerful software used for 3D modeling, rendering, and animation. These files serve as repositories for three-dimensional character models, which can encompass both static and animated characters. Inside a ".chr" file, you'll find a comprehensive representation of the character, including its geometry (shape and structure), textures (surface appearance), lighting effects, and various other properties related to the 3D model.

These character models are instrumental in the creation of characters that find their way into various media forms, such as video games, movies, and television productions. By encapsulating all the essential visual and structural elements within a ".chr" file, 3D artists and animators can efficiently develop and manipulate characters for use in these different forms of entertainment.

## 3ds Max

3ds Max is a powerful and widely used 3D modeling, rendering, and animation software developed by Autodesk. It is known for its versatility and extensive feature set, making it a popular choice among professionals in industries such as architecture, product design, film and television production, video game development, and more.

Here are some key features and capabilities of 3ds Max:

1.  **3D Modeling:** 3ds Max offers a robust set of tools for creating 3D models, whether they are architectural designs, characters, vehicles, or any other 3D objects. It supports both polygonal and parametric modeling techniques.
    
2.  **Animation:** It provides advanced animation tools, including keyframe animation, character rigging, and character animation. Artists can create complex animations for characters and objects with ease.
    
3.  **Rendering:** 3ds Max includes a high-quality rendering engine that allows users to generate realistic images and animations. It supports various rendering techniques, such as ray tracing, global illumination, and ambient occlusion.
    
4.  **Texturing and Materials:** Artists can apply textures and materials to 3D models to achieve realistic surface appearances. The software supports procedural textures and allows for the creation of custom materials.
       
5.  **Scripting and Automation:** 3ds Max can be extended and customized through MaxScript, a scripting language built into the software. This allows users to automate tasks and create custom tools and plugins.

## 3ds Max: Saving and Exporting Character Files

3ds Max has the capability to convert and store character files with a ".chr" extension into its native ".MAX" file format. Additionally, it offers the functionality to export character files in a variety of formats, encompassing options like

- [DAE](/3d/dae/)
- [FBX](/3d/fbx/)
- [DXF](/cad/dxf/)
- [IGS](/cad/igs/)
- [STL](/cad/stl/) and numerous others.
