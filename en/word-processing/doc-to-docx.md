## About DOC to DOCX Conversion

Before Microsoft introduced Office 2007, all your word documents were saved in binary DOC file format by default. With the introduction of Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft switched from all its binary file formats to Open Office XML specifications file format. After this move, each binary extension was appended with an "X" to represent the new file format. You may still have archived your old DOC files that may need conversion to the new DOCX file format. Several tools online let you convert DOC to DOCX for free. Aspose.Words app is one such online tool that lets you convert DOC to DOCX from within your browser.
