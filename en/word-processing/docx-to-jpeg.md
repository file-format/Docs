## About DOCX to Image Conversion

Almost everyone of us is familiar with working with word documents. Microsoft Office saves these documents in popular [DOCX](/word-processing/docx/) file format, but it does not have any option to save DOCX to image file formats such as [JPEG](/image/jpeg/) or [PNG](/image/png/). Situations can arise where a DOCX file needs to be embedded in a presentation as an JPEG image or you need to upload a document to online website that only accepts image files. That is where certain online tools come forward to help you convert your DOCX files to JPEG online.
