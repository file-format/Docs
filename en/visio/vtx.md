## What is a VTX file?

A file with .vtx extension is a Microsoft Visio drawing template that is saved to disc in XML file format. The template is aimed to provide a file with basic settings that can be used to create multiple Visio files of the same settings. Another similar format is [VST](/visio/vst/) which is saved in binary format rather than XML. VTX files are supported with Visio 2010 and newer versions. Visio files are used to create drawings that contain visual objects, flow charts, UML diagram, information flow, organizational charts, software diagrams, network layout, database models, objects mapping and other similar information. Files generated using Visio can also be exported to different file formats such as [PNG](/image/png/), [BMP](/image/bmp/), PDF and others.

Certain other file types that comprise the Visio 2013 file format include:

* .vsdm (Visio macro-enabled drawing)
* .vssx (Visio stencil)
* .vssm (Visio macro-enabled stencil)
* .vstx (Visio template)
* .vstm (Visio macro-enabled template)
