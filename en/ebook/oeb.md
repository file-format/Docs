## What is an OEB file?

The OEB files were introduced by the International Digital Publishing Forum (**IDPF**). More formally, the OEB files are also known as **OEBPS**. These files are XML-based specifications for the structure, content, and presentation of electronic books. This file format has been superseded by the [EPUB](/ebook/epub/) format.

## Technical Details of OEB File Format

The OEB file format consists of a set of files, including a compulsory package file, which includes a manifest listing all the other component files, and a spine, which indicates logical reading order. Moreover, to text in [XML](/web/xml/), a reader for OEB files must be able to render images in [JPEG](/image/jpeg/) and [PNG](/image/png/) formats. Content components in other formats may be incorporated, but fallback content must be provided in one of the basic OEB formats.

The OEBPS 1.2 was a tightly coupled update to the prior version (OEBPS 1.0.1). It provided modern functionality in the area of rendering control, including, among other things, enhancements in the markup vocabulary (now a genuine subset of XHTML 1.1), and greatly expanded CSS support. Sustainability factors are unchanged from the earlier version.
  
The OEB bundle of files was used primarily as a mid-state format, with publication to end-users managed through publishers or aggregators who provided ebooks in forms suitable for different ebook viewers. Its successor version, [EPUB](/ebook/epub/), is more likely to reach end-users as a final-state format, as well as serving as a middle-state format.
