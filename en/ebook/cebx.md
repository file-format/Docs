## What is a CEBX file?

The files with the .cebx (Chinese ebook) extension are known as **Apabi eBook files** which actually replaced the [CEB](/ebook/ceb/) file format. A CEBX file includes Chinese formatted text and other layout information, therefore, this file format has been discontinued. The CEBX file format was developed by Founder Electronics's Apabi publishers. The files of this format are available from the APABI D-Lib library which includes a collection of Chinese eBooks. These binary encoded files can be displayed by using Apabi software. The **Apabi Reader 4.5.2 for Multi-Language** for Microsoft Windows, **Apabi Reader for Android 1.8.1** and **Apabi Reader for iOS 2.4.0**  supports the CEBX file formats.
