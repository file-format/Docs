## What is a PMLZ file?

Palm Inc introduced an eBook file type; known as the PMLZ file format which a compressed version of [PML](/ebook/pml/) file format that's why the files with .pmlz extensions are known as **Zipped Palm Markup Language File**. The PMLZ file is just a zip container of a file that compiles [PDB](/programming/pdb/) files to create docs for **eReader** (Known as an ebook reading device such as a tablet computer). The PML file gives the layout to a PDB file (containing various data files) to display on a Palm Device. Whereas, a PDB file is a database file, which is used by various applications, including Quicken, Pegasus, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Palm Pilot. In short, a PMLZ is a compressed container of PML and PDB files.  


## Knowledge about Palm Markup Language
The following table specifies the PML commands:

|Command|Description|
---|---|
|             \p              |                                                                                                                              New page                                                                                                                               |
|             \x              |                                                                                New chapter; also causes a new page break. Enclose chapter title (and any style codes) with \x and \x                                                                                |
|             \Xn             |                                            New chapter, indented n levels (n between 0 and 4 inclusive) in the Chapter dialog; doesn't cause a page break. Enclose chapter title (and any style codes) with \Xn and \Xn                                             |
|     \Cn="Chapter title"     | Insert "Chapter title" into the chapter listing, with level n (like \Xn). The text is not shown on the page and does not force a page break. This can sometimes be useful to insert a chapter mark at the beginning of an introduction to the chapter, for example. |
