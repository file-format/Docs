## What is an LRS file?

A file with .lrs (Librie Reader Source) extension refers to an intermediate file used by Sony Portable Reader. It contains information that acts as a source for the creation of a Sony Broadband eBook (BBeB). LRS files contain details about the eBook file in the form of descriptions of the content and properties. LRS files are used to create [LRF](/ebook/lrf/) and LRX files using publicly available tools and APIs. Several software applications such as Calibre, BookDesignerMkelrf, and Canon Book Creator can be used to open LRS files on Windows, Linux, and MAC.

## LRS File Format

LRS files are based on [XML](/web/xml/) file format and its specifications are available publicly as XML is both readable by humans as well as machines. Unlike LRS, LRF files are in a binary proprietary format and their public details are not available.
