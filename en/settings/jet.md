## What is a JET file?

A ".jet" file is a settings file unique to **The Jackbox Party Pack** series of video games. These files are crucial for configuring various aspects of specific party games within the collection. Typically, they store settings and instructions in either JSON or XML format. An example of this can be seen in The Jackbox Party Pack 2, where a game like Earwax utilizes a JET file named "EarwaxAudio.jet" to manage and play audio files associated with the game.

These ".jet" files essentially act as blueprints for game parameters, helping ensure that each party game within The Jackbox Party Pack series runs smoothly and offers the intended gameplay experience. They allow for the customization of game settings, such as audio cues, game rules, and other important details, contributing to the unique and enjoyable multiplayer experience that these games are known for.

## JET File Format - More Information

The Jackbox Party Pack is a collection of video games, each featuring a variety of fun party games designed for multiplayer entertainment. For instance, in The Jackbox Party Pack 2, you'll find a selection of five party games, including Fibbage 2, Earwax, Bidiots, Quiplash XL, and Bomb Corp.

To make these games tick, they rely on specific game data stored in dedicated sub-directories. Let's take Earwax as an example. Earwax stores its game data in a directory structure like this:

```
~/Jackbox Games/The Jackbox Party Pack 2/games/Earwax
```

Within these sub-directories, you'll discover one or more JET settings files. These files serve a crucial role in defining various aspects of the game, such as what text appears, which media files are used, and when these elements are displayed throughout the gameplay. Notably, all JET files are plain text files, which means that modders and enthusiasts have the opportunity to edit them. This editing capability allows for customizing the in-game content, from text and images to sounds, enabling players to personalize their gaming experience or create unique twists on the games.

## How to open JET file?

Since JET files are in plain text format, they can be accessed and modified using any text editing software. e.g.

- Microsoft Notepad (Windows)
