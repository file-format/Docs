## What is an MLT file?

An MLT file is essentially a project file used by the open-source video editor, **Meltytech Shotcut**. Instead of storing actual video, audio, or images, it stores project settings in XML format. These settings include details about the media files you've imported into your project, how they're arranged on the timeline, any effects you've applied to them, and various video and audio properties.

In simple terms, think of an MLT file as a blueprint or a map that tells Shotcut how to recreate your video project. When you open an MLT file in Shotcut, it reads the instructions within the file and reconstructs your project with all its media, edits, and effects so you can continue working on it or export it as a final video in a standard format.

## Meltytech Shotcut

Meltytech Shotcut, often referred to simply as "Shotcut," is a free and open-source video editing software. It is designed to provide users with a versatile and accessible platform for editing videos on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Shotcut offers a range of features for video editing, including the ability to import and arrange video and audio clips on a timeline, apply transitions and effects, adjust audio levels, and export the final edited video in different formats and resolutions.
