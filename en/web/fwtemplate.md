## What is a FWTEMPLATE file?

An FWTEMPLATE is a template document to create websites without writing any code. It was developed by Freeway Pro and provides a way to create multiple templates that can be readily used to create website documents. FWTEMPLATE files contains information about a website's appearance (UI) and its layout for organizing various parts of the website. This can be used to create a theme based template once and use mutliple times. FWTEMPLATE files can be opened with Softpress Freeway Pro.

## FWTEMPLATE File Format - More information

FWTEMPLATE files are created and saved in Freeway proprietary file format. The regular [HTML](/web/html/) templates used to create websites can not be used with Freeway. Instead, these need to be recreated in Freeway and then let Freeway build HTML structures quicker than any other application.
