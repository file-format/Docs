## What is an A5W file?

An A5W file is a server-side webpage created wit [Alpha Five](https://www.alphasoftware.com/) software and contains code that is served to users when accessed via browser. It is similar to the [.asp](/web/asp/) and [.php](/programming/php/) pages but differs in syntax as these are written in [Alpha Five syntax](https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/pages/GettingStarted/index.html). Alpha Five is a cross platform web and mobile applications development tool for rapid application tool. It also lets you create dynamic webpage components and browser-run desktop-like applications. A5W files can be opened in Alpha 5 Software.

## A5W File Format

A5W files are plain text files that contain source code along with webpage code written with Alpha Five syntax. When a user requests a webpage that is written and saved as A5W webpage, the Alpha Five server parses the source code and converts the resulting webpage file to the requesting browser for display.

## A5W Syntax

The Alpha Five source code uses starting and ending tags of <%a5 and a5>. Code is written between these tags that is translated by server when a page request is received. The [Alpha Five documentation](https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/pages/index.html) section comprises of User's Guide, API Reference, and a number of How To's for learning and application development with Alpha Five syntax.
