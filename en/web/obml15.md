## What is an OBML15 file?

An OBML15 file is a webpage saved to mobile devices using Opera Mini mobile web browser. It is based on the Opera Binary Markup Language (OBML) that was the initial version of this type of file format. OBML15 replaced [OBML](/web/obml) with the release of Opera Mini version 5, while it was itself replaced by OBML16 later on. Each Opera Mini version is compatible with one OBML format only i.e. upgrades of Opera Mini will not be able to read the previous versions of saved pages. OBML15 files can be converted to [PDF](/pdf/) and [HTML](/web/html/) online.

## OBML15 File Format

OBML15 files are saved to disc as binary files in Opera's proprietary file format that is not available publicly. Opera users download and save the webpages as compact OBML files which take less time to download. The [OBML file format](https://github.com/grawity/obml-parser/blob/master/obml.md) was reverse engineered and some of its structure was decoded to some extent.
