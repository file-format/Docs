## What is a DISCOMAP file?

A DISCOMAP file is an output file that is created by the Microsoft Web Services Discovery Tool, **Disco.exe**. It contains the results that are ASP.NET Web Services discovered at at specific URL. Common examples of such discovered services include locations of a .DISCO or .WSDL files. When the Microsoft Web Discovery tool runs, it searches for discovering information based on the XML content found in the DISCO file. The results are stored in the DISCOMAP file that can be opened with Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
