## What is a BOK file?

A BOK file is a webpage file created by ProStores, once a popular web-based e-commerce platform that was later acquired by eBay. Like other webpages, BOK file contains dynamic content generated from the data available in the ProStores database. The BOK webpage is then hosted to the ProStores platform for listing products that are available to users for purchase. BOK page owners used to generate their store pages on ProStores and list the products for customers.

BOK files can be edited with eBay ProStores and opened in any web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, and Apple Safari.

## BOK File Format

BOK files are saved as webpages that are generally in browser understandable file format such as [HTML](/web/html/) or [PHP](/programming/php/). The contents of these pages are loaded from the ProStores database at run time when some customer visits the storefront.
