## What is an ATT file?

An ATT file is an intermediate file generated by Web forms when a user submits data using the form in a web browser. When the data is submitted using the web form, the data is stored in the ATT file and is also emailed to the designated user. The ATT files are received as an attachment to the emails in cases where the encoding type is incorrect.

Applications that can **open ATT files** include text editors such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, and Atom.
