## What is a BR file?

A BR file is a compressed web file generated by applying the open source data compression algorithm, **Brotli**. It is used to store webpage assets such as stylesheets ([CSS](/web/css/)), images ([SVG](/image/svg/)), [XML](/web/xml/), and scripting files ([JS](/web/js/)). Modern day websites, such as Chrome and Firefox, use BR files to reduce the page loading time, resulting in better user experience.

## BR File Format

BR files are compressed web files that are generated using the Brotli compression algorithm. Brotli compression is a lossless data compression algorithm and was developed by Google to Zopfli compression algorithm. It is based on a combination of the LZ77 lossless compression algorithm and Huffman coding.

Due to its small size, BR files are used by web servers and content delivery networks (CDN). The requests made to these servers results in compression of HTTP content, making websites load faster. Brotli has become more popular and provides better compression than gzip.
