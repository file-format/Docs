## What is a DBM file?

A file with .dbm (Database Markup Language) extension is a ColdFusion Server File that was developed by Adobe Systems. It is a server-side file that is executed on web server having ColdFusion. It is similar to the [ASP](/web/asp/) and [PHP](/web/php/) files and generate [HTML](/web/html/) when a user requests the page in the web browser. DBM files can be opened in applications such as Adobe ColdFusion, Adobe ColdFusion Builder, MacroMates TextMate, and Apple Safari.

## DBM File Format

DBM files are created and saved as plain text files on the server where ColdFusion is running. Result of DBM file is an HTML file that is rendered to user's browser when a request is sent to the server. The request is processed on the server and output is generated. DBML was used by the earlier versions of ColdFusion and has been replaced by the [.cfm](/web/cfm/) file format.
