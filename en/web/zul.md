## What is a ZUL file?

A file with .zul extension is a web file created with the User Interface Markup Language (ZUML) and contains definitions for user interface elements. Ajax and Java classes support using the [XML](/web/xml/)-based ZUML for developing server side files. ZUL file format was developed by ZK, a UI framework that enables you to build web and mobile applications without the knowledge of JavaScript or AJAX.

## ZUL File Format

ZUL files are XML-based, consisting of different elements to construct user interface. The ZK loader uses each XML element to create a component. The overall processing of the page elements such as page title, description, etc. are described by each XML processing instruction of ZUML.

### ZUL Example

In the following example of ZUML code, the first line specifies the page title, the second line creates a root component with title and border, and the third line creates a button with label and an event listener.

```
<?page title="Super Application"?>
<window title="Super Hello" border="normal">
    <button label="hi" onClick='alert("hi")'/>
```
