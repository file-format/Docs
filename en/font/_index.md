When you switch ON your computer and the operating system is loaded, you see text on your screen with different icons, on buttons, taskbar, and other similar places. Each of these is displayed with different fonts (if configured). Ever wondered how does the operating system to know different files? Or how the applications installed on your computer list different font types for your selection? This is all done using Font files that contain fonts information such as font tables, glyphs, and script outlines that can be accessed by operating system and applications to render text. Popular file formats include [TTF](/font/ttf/), [OTF](/font/otf/), [CFF](/font/cff/) and [EOT](/font/eot/).
