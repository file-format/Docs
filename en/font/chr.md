## What is a CHR file?

A CHR file can also serve as font configuration file utilized by Microsoft Windows. This type of file stores essential data used for adjusting size and style of fonts within operating system. Software applications that interact with system fonts can make use of these ".chr" files to customize how these fonts appear on screen.

## Borland Character Set

A "character set" refers to predefined collection of characters, symbols, or glyphs that are associated with specific numeric codes. Each character within set is assigned unique code or identifier, often represented as numeric value. Character sets are fundamental in encoding and representing text in computers and digital systems.

Here are few key points about character sets:

1.  **ASCII Character Set:** One of most well-known character sets is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set, which includes characters like letters, digits, punctuation marks and control characters. ASCII uses 7 or 8 bits to represent each character.
    
2.  **Unicode:** Unicode is widely used character set that aims to encompass characters from all writing systems in world. It uses unique code point (a numeric value) for each character, allowing for representation of characters from various languages, scripts and symbols.
    
3.  **Character Encoding:** Character sets are often used in conjunction with character encodings. A character encoding is mapping between character codes and binary representations (usually bytes) that can be stored or transmitted digitally. Common character encodings include UTF-8 and UTF-16 for Unicode.
    
4.  **Language Support:** Character sets can vary in terms of language support. Some character sets are specific to certain languages or scripts, while others are more comprehensive and support multiple languages.
    
5.  **Legacy Character Sets:** In past, different computer systems and regions used their own character sets, which could cause issues when sharing data between systems. Unicode has largely addressed these compatibility issues.
    
6.  **HTML and Web:** When working with web development and HTML, specifying character set in document's metadata (e.g., using `<meta>` tag with "charset" attribute) is important to ensure proper text rendering.

## How to open a CHR file

CHR files are not intended for manual opening or editing by users. Instead, they serve as configuration files that Windows programs, particularly those that interact with system fonts, can access when necessary. These programs load CHR files to retrieve information about how specific fonts should be displayed, including details about their size, style and other attributes. Users typically do not need to interact directly with CHR files, as font management is handled by operating system and software applications.

## Other CHR files

Here are other file types that use the **.chr** file extension.
