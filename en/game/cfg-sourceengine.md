## What is a CFG file?

CFG file in the context of **Valve's Source Engine**, as seen in games like Half-Life 2, serves as a configuration file. These files are used to alter various in-game settings through a list of plain text commands. These commands are typically arranged with one per line and are responsible for customizing aspects of the game.

Players and server administrators have a couple of options for applying the changes specified in a `.cfg` file:

1.  **Manual Execution**: Users can manually execute the commands within the CFG file. This means that they enter each command one by one in the game's Developer Console. This method allows for precise control over which settings are changed and when.
    
2.  **Automatic Execution**: Alternatively, players can opt for automatic execution. This involves placing the `.cfg` file in the appropriate game directory. Certain `.cfg` files, like `autoexec.cfg`, are executed automatically when the game starts. This ensures that the specified settings are applied without requiring manual input every time the game launches.
