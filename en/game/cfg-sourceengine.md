## What is a CFG file?

CFG file in the context of **Valve's Source Engine**, as seen in games like Half-Life 2, serves as configuration file. These files are used to alter various in-game settings through list of plain text commands. These commands are typically arranged with one per line and are responsible for customizing aspects of game.
