## What is a CS file?

A .CS file in context of CLEO (short for CLEO Library) typically refers to a custom script file used in Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series of video games. CLEO is a popular modding framework that allows players to create and add custom scripts to GTA games enabling them to modify gameplay, add new features and enhance overall gaming experience.

## Overview of CS file

Here is a basic overview of what a .cs file in CLEO might contain:

1.  **Script Code**: A .cs file contains script code written in CLEO scripting language. This scripting language is specific to CLEO and is used to define behavior of custom scripts within game. The code can be written using a text editor and it typically follows a specific syntax.
    
2.  **Modifications**: CLEO scripts can make various modifications to game such as changing behavior of in-game objects, creating custom missions, adding new vehicles, weapons and more. The possibilities are extensive and depend on creativity and programming skills of script author.
    
3.  **Triggers**: CLEO scripts often include triggers that determine when and how custom script should run. These triggers can be based on in-game events, player actions or specific conditions.
    
4.  **Variables and Functions**: CLEO scripts can use variables to store and manipulate data, as well as functions to encapsulate and reuse code. These variables and functions are used to control behavior of script.

## Example of CS file

Here is a simple example of a CLEO .cs script that changes weather in game:

```
{$CLEO .cs}

03A4: name_thread 'WEATHER'

:WEATHER_LOOP
    // Change the weather to sunny
    0085: 0@ = 11 // Weather ID for sunny weather
    00D8: mission_cleanup
    0051: return 0@ // Exit the script

// Add more code and conditions as needed
```

## File Formats Used by CLEO Library

In CLEO modding for Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games, several file formats are commonly used to create and install mods. These file formats serve various purposes from containing actual scripts to storing additional resources such as textures, models or audio. Here are some of key file formats used in CLEO modding:

1.  **.cs (Custom Script)**: CLEO .cs files are custom script files written in CLEO scripting language. These files contain code that defines behavior and functionality of mod. .cs files are core of CLEO modding and are executed by game to implement custom features.
    
2.  **.csa (Custom Script Archive)**: .csa files are archives that can store multiple .cs script files. They are often used to package related scripts together for easier installation and management.
    
3.  **.fxt (Text Files)**: .fxt files are text files that can be used to localize or provide text translations for CLEO mods. They contain text strings that can be displayed in game, making mods accessible to players in different languages.
    
4.  **[.bmp](/image/bmp/), [.png](/image/png/), [.jpg](/image/jpeg/) (Image Formats)**: These image formats are used to store textures and images for mods. They can be used for custom skins, vehicle textures, HUD elements and more. Depending on game, different image formats may be preferred.

## How to open CS file?
