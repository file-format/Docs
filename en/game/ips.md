## What is an IPS file?

An "IPS file" typically refers to an "Internal Patching System Patch File." IPS is an abbreviation for "International Patching System," and it is a file format used for creating and applying patches to ROM (Read-Only Memory) files, often in the context of video game emulation and ROM hacking.

Here is how it works:

- **Original ROM:** You start with an original ROM file, which is essentially a copy of a video game or software stored in a ROM format. This file is typically read-only, meaning you cannot modify it directly.

- **IPS Patch File:** An IPS patch file contains the changes you want to apply to the original ROM. These changes could be bug fixes, translations, or other modifications.

- **Patch Application:** To apply the changes, you need a utility or program that can read the IPS patch file and apply it to the original ROM. This process essentially "patches" the original ROM file with the changes specified in the IPS file, creating a modified ROM file.

- **Modified ROM:** The result is a modified ROM that incorporates the changes from the IPS patch file. This modified ROM can then be used in an emulator or on compatible hardware to play the game with the desired modifications.

These patches are typically used for making alterations or improvements to games, and they can encompass various changes, including modifications to graphics, models, and other game data. IPS files are particularly suitable for relatively small patches, typically less than 16 megabytes in size.

In the following section, we will explore the software applications associated with IPS files.

## Lunar IPS

Lunar IPS is a popular and user-friendly utility used for creating and applying IPS (Internal Patching System) patches to ROM files. Here are some key features and information about Lunar IPS:

- **Patch Creation:** Lunar IPS allows users to create IPS patches by specifying the changes they want to make to an original ROM file. You can select the original ROM and the modified version, and Lunar IPS will generate an IPS patch file based on the differences between the two files.

- **Patch Application:** Once you have an IPS patch file, Lunar IPS lets you apply it to an original ROM. This process essentially "patches" the ROM with the changes specified in the IPS file, creating a modified ROM.

- **Lightweight:** Lunar IPS is a small and lightweight program, which means it doesn't consume much system resources and is quick to download and run.

## IPSWin

IPSWin is a utility primarily designed for Windows users that facilitates the creation and application of IPS (Internal Patching System) patches to ROM files. It is a straightforward and user-friendly tool, suitable for those looking to patch ROMs easily. Here is some information about IPSWin:

- **Patch Creation:** IPSWin allows users to create IPS patches by comparing two ROM files: the original ROM and the modified ROM. It identifies the differences between the two files and generates an IPS patch file containing those changes.

- **Patch Application:** This utility also enables users to apply existing IPS patch files to original ROMs. By selecting the appropriate IPS patch and original ROM, IPSWin will merge the changes into a new ROM file, creating a patched version.
