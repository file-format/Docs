## What is an NDS file?

The ".nds" file extension is commonly associated with **Nintendo DS (Dual Screen)** game ROMs (Read-Only Memory). The Nintendo DS is a handheld gaming console that was released by Nintendo in 2004; while ROMs are digital copies of game cartridges or discs allowing users to play games on emulators or flashcarts.

If you have a .NDS file, it likely contains the game data for a Nintendo DS game. To play the game, you would typically use a Nintendo DS emulator on your computer or flashcart on actual Nintendo DS console. Emulators simulate hardware of original console allowing you to play games on different platform, while flashcarts are physical devices that allow you to load and play ROMs on original console.

Emulators like DeSmuME, NO$GBA, iDeaS Emulator, OpenEmu, and Exophase DraStic DS Emulator replicate the functionality of the Nintendo DS on a computer, allowing users to enjoy these games without the need for the original console. These emulators often come with additional features such as improved graphics settings, customizable gameplay options and even cheat functionalities, enhancing the gaming experience for users.
