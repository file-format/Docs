## What is an RPF file?

The RPF file is commonly associated with the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) game series, particularly with the PC version. These files are archives that contain various game data, such as models, textures, scripts, and other resources used by the game engine.

## RPF File Format - More Information

In Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), for example, .rpf files are used extensively to organize and store game assets. They are usually found within game's installation directory in "update" or "x64" folders. These files are often encrypted or compressed to protect game's assets and prevent easy modification by users.

Modding communities often work with .rpf files to create custom content, mods, or tweaks for game. Tools have been developed to extract, modify, and repack these files, allowing users to customize their GTA experience beyond what base game offers.
