## What is an ASSET file?

An ASSET file is a special file used in Unity, a program for making video games. It holds important configurations like game objects or settings. For example, one ASSET file might store how objects move in the game, like how they bounce off each other or fall down. These files are like containers that keep all the important information organized so that game developers can easily work on their projects.

## How to open an ASSET file
  
In Unity, you do not typically "open" asset files in the same way you would open a document or file in a text editor or similar program. Instead, Unity manages asset files within the Unity Editor itself. Here is how you can access and work with asset files in Unity:

1.  **Import Assets**: To use an asset file in your Unity project, you need to import it into project. You can do this by either dragging and dropping asset file directly into Unity Editor or by using "Assets" menu and selecting "Import New Asset."
    
2.  **Viewing Assets**: Once imported, you can view and manage asset files in "Project" window of Unity Editor. This window displays all the assets in your project and allows you to organize them into folders, search for specific assets, and preview their contents.
    
3.  **Using Assets**: You can use asset files in your Unity project by dragging them from "Project" window into your scene hierarchy or onto GameObjects in scene. For example, you can drag a texture asset onto a material to apply it to a 3D object, or you can drag a prefab asset into scene to instantiate a pre-configured GameObject.
    
4.  **Editing Assets**: Some asset files, such as scripts, materials, and animations, can be edited directly within Unity Editor. You can double-click on these assets in "Project" window to open them in their respective editors and make changes as needed.
    
5.  **Saving Assets**: Any changes you make to asset files within Unity Editor are automatically saved within your Unity project. There's no need to explicitly save individual asset files like you would with a document in a traditional software program.

ASSET files can be opened or referenced using the following programs.
