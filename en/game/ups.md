## What is a UPS file?

A UPS file, which stands for **Universal Patching System**, is a type of patch file used to modify or apply changes to the data of a video game or other software. UPS files are typically used in the emulation community to apply patches or modifications to ROMs (Read-Only Memory) of old video games.

## UPS Patch File

Here is how a UPS patch file works:

1.  **Original Data:** You start with the original ROM file of a video game or software that you want to modify. This ROM contains the game's code and data.
    
2.  **Patch File:** A UPS patch file is created using specialized patching software. This patch file contains the changes you want to apply to the original data. These changes can include bug fixes, translation patches, or other modifications.
    
3.  **Patching Process:** To apply the changes, you use a UPS patching tool, which takes the original ROM and the UPS patch file as input. The patching tool then applies the changes specified in the UPS patch file to the original ROM, creating a modified version of the game or software.
    
4.  **Result:** The output is a patched or modified ROM that incorporates the changes from the UPS patch file. This patched ROM can then be played on an emulator or used in other ways, depending on the modifications made.
    

UPS patch files are popular in the emulation community because they allow users to make improvements or modifications to old games without distributing the entire game's ROM, which may be subject to copyright. Instead, users can share only the UPS patch file, which contains the changes, and users can apply it to their legally owned original ROM.

UPS patches offer several advantages over [IPS](/game/ips/):

1.  **No Size Limitation:** Unlike IPS patches, which are restricted to 16MB, UPS patches can be used with files of any size. This flexibility makes UPS particularly useful for larger games and software.
    
2.  **Bi-Directional Patching:** UPS supports bi-directional patching, which means a single UPS patch can both apply and remove changes to a game or software. This feature simplifies the process of modifying or reverting alterations, enhancing the user's experience.
    
3.  **CRC32 Checksums:** UPS employs CRC32 checksums as a built-in mechanism to ensure that patches are applied to the correct game or software. This checksum verification helps maintain the integrity of the patched files and prevents accidental or incorrect application of patches.

## How to apply a UPS patch?

To apply a UPS patch, you'll need a UPS patching tool, such as Lunar IPS (for Windows), NUPS (for Windows), or MultiPatch (for multiple platforms), and the original ROM of the game or software you want to patch.
