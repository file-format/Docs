## What is a UPS file?

A UPS file, which stands for **Universal Patching System**, is a type of patch file used to modify or apply changes to data of a video game or other software. UPS files are typically used in emulation community to apply patches or modifications to ROMs (Read-Only Memory) of old video games.

## UPS Patch File

Here is how a UPS patch file works:

1.  **Original Data:** You start with original ROM file of a video game or software that you want to modify. This ROM contains game's code and data.
    
2.  **Patch File:** A UPS patch file is created using specialized patching software. This patch file contains changes you want to apply to original data. These changes can include bug fixes, translation patches or other modifications.
    
3.  **Patching Process:** To apply changes you use a UPS patching tool which takes original ROM and UPS patch file as input. The patching tool then applies changes specified in UPS patch file to original ROM creating a modified version of game or software.
    
4.  **Result:** The output is a patched or modified ROM that incorporates changes from UPS patch file. This patched ROM can then be played on an emulator or used in other ways depending on modifications made.
    

UPS patch files are popular in emulation community because they allow users to make improvements or modifications to old games without distributing entire game's ROM which may be subject to copyright. Instead users can share only UPS patch file which contains changes and users can apply it to their legally owned original ROM.

UPS patches offer several advantages over [IPS](/game/ips/):

1.  **No Size Limitation:** Unlike IPS patches which are restricted to 16MB, UPS patches can be used with files of any size. This flexibility makes UPS particularly useful for larger games and software.
    
2.  **Bi-Directional Patching:** UPS supports bi-directional patching which means a single UPS patch can both apply and remove changes to a game or software. This feature simplifies process of modifying or reverting alterations, enhancing user's experience.
    
3.  **CRC32 Checksums:** UPS employs CRC32 checksums as a built-in mechanism to ensure that patches are applied to correct game or software. This checksum verification helps maintain integrity of patched files and prevents accidental or incorrect application of patches.

## How to apply a UPS patch?

To apply a UPS patch, you'll need a UPS patching tool, such as Lunar IPS (for Windows), NUPS (for Windows), or MultiPatch (for multiple platforms) and original ROM of game or software you want to patch.
