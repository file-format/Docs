## What is an IPS file?

An IPS file may also be associated with PlayStation 2 video games. These IPS files contain in-game videos, including cutscenes or other cinematic elements used to enhance the gameplay experience. These videos are typically encoded in the .IPU format and often include audio that is encoded using the ADPCM codec.

IPS files containing in-game videos were notably used in PlayStation 2 games, including some entries in the Megami Tensei role-playing game franchise. It is worth noting that while the IPS format was utilized in these games, it is not a proprietary format exclusive to a single developer. As a result, various game developers incorporated IPS videos into their PlayStation 2 titles. For instance, the game "Wipeout Fusion" is one such example of a game that includes IPS files. It's important to mention that there might be slight variations in the formatting of IPS files from game to game.

In the following sections, we will explore the software applications associated with IPS files.

## PlayStation 2 Games

PlayStation 2 (PS2) games refer to video games designed to be played on the PlayStation 2, a popular gaming console released by Sony in the year 2000. The PlayStation 2 was one of the most successful gaming consoles of all time, with a vast library of games spanning various genres. Here are some key points about PlayStation 2 games:

- **Diverse Game Library:** The PS2 had an extensive and diverse game library, featuring titles ranging from action-adventure, role-playing, sports, racing, simulation, and more. It hosted a wide range of iconic franchises like "Grand Theft Auto," "Final Fantasy," "Metal Gear Solid," and "Kingdom Hearts."

- **Optical Disc Format:** PS2 games were primarily distributed on DVD-ROM discs, which allowed for larger game worlds and more detailed graphics compared to its predecessor, the PlayStation 1.

- **DualShock Controller:** The PS2 used the DualShock 2 controller, an updated version of the original DualShock controller. It featured analog sticks, vibration feedback, and improved button layout for immersive gameplay.

- **Emulation and Preservation:** Due to its popularity, many PS2 games have been emulated on modern systems and preserved for future generations through emulation and remastering efforts.

## IPUDecoder

IPUDecoder is a software tool used for decoding and converting .IPU video files commonly found in PlayStation 2 (PS2) games. These .IPU video files contain compressed video data used for in-game cutscenes and cinematics on the PS2. Here's some key information about IPUDecoder:

- **Purpose:** IPUDecoder is primarily used to extract video content from .IPU files and convert it into more standard video formats like .M2V (MPEG-2 Video). This allows users to work with the video outside of the PS2 environment, such as for video editing or preservation purposes.

- **Video Conversion:** The primary function of IPUDecoder is to convert .IPU video files into a more standard format (typically .M2V). This conversion makes it easier to work with the video in modern video editing software or to enjoy PS2 game videos on other devices.

- **Usage Considerations:** While IPUDecoder can be a valuable tool for working with .IPU video files, the quality of the extracted video may still reflect the original limitations of the PS2 hardware, including resolution and compression artifacts.

## QuickBMS

QuickBMS is a versatile and powerful file extraction tool used for extracting files from various data formats and archives. It was developed by Luigi Auriemma and is particularly popular in the gaming and modding communities. Here are some key features and information about QuickBMS:

- **File Extraction:** QuickBMS is primarily used for extracting files from data archives, game resource files, and other container formats. It can be used to access the contents of proprietary or compressed files commonly found in video games.

- **Scripting Language:** QuickBMS uses its own scripting language that allows users to create custom scripts for handling specific file formats. These scripts define how the data within a particular file or archive is to be extracted and processed.

- **Preservation and Modding:** QuickBMS is commonly used in the preservation of video games and for creating mods. It allows users to extract and manipulate game assets, which can be essential for preserving gaming history or enhancing gameplay experiences through mods.

## How to convert an IPS file

If you want to convert IPS files, which are often found in PlayStation 2 games, into more commonly used formats, here are two methods you can use:

- **Using IPUDecoder (multiplatform):** IPUDecoder is a versatile tool that allows you to convert IPS files into the .M2V (MPEG-2 Video) format. This can be handy if you want to work with the video portion of the IPS file in a standard video format.

- **Using QuickBMS and IPS Demux Script (Windows):** Another option is to use QuickBMS, which is a tool for extracting files from various game formats. In this case, you would also need an associated IPS Demux script. This combination can convert an IPS file into separate components, typically an .IPU video file and a [.WAV](/audio/wav/) audio file. However, effectiveness of the IPS Demux script may vary depending on the specific IPS file you are working with, as not all IPS files are formatted identically.

## How to open IPS file?

Programs that open IPS files include

- IPUDecoder (Free) for (Windows, MAC, Linux)
- QuickBMS (Free)

## Other IPS files

Here are other file types that use the **.ips** file extension.

- [IPS - Internal Patching System Patch File](/game/ips/)
- [IPS - iOS Analytics Data](/misc/ips/)
