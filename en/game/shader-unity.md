## What is a SHADER file?

A **"Unity Shader Asset"** refers to shader created in Unity game development engine. In Unity, shaders are used to control how rendering of graphics is done, defining how objects and materials appear in 3D scene. Shaders can be used to manipulate lighting, texture mapping, and various other visual effects in Unity project.

## Unity Shader Asset

A Unity Shader Asset typically consists of Shader Graph or ShaderLab file. Here is brief explanation of both:

1.  **Shader Graph**: Unity introduced Shader Graph as visual tool for creating shaders. It allows developers to create shaders without writing code. You can visually connect nodes to define how materials should behave. The Shader Graph file typically has ".shadergraph" extension.
    
2.  **ShaderLab**: ShaderLab is markup language used in Unity to write shaders. It allows developers to define properties and behaviors of shader in text-based format. A ShaderLab file typically has ".shader" extension.
    
## Working with SHADER Assets

To work with Shader Assets in Unity, you would typically do following:

1.  Create new Shader Asset using Unity's Shader Graph or by writing ShaderLab code.
    
2.  Attach Shader Asset to material in Unity. This material can then be applied to objects in your game or scene.
    
3.  Customize and modify Shader Asset as needed to achieve desired visual effects or rendering behavior.
    
4.  Use Shader Asset to control various aspects of rendering, including how objects react to lighting, shadows, and materials.
    
5.  You can also animate properties within shader for dynamic visual effects.
    

By using Shader Assets in Unity, you can create visually stunning and unique graphics for your games or applications.

## How to open SHADER file

Programs that open or reference SHADER files include

- **Unity Technologies Unity** (Free) for (Windows, Mac, Linux)

Besides, these files are plain text files, so you can use any text editor to view their contents. You can use

- Notepad
- Notepad++
- Visual Studio Code

## Other SHADER files

Here are other file types that use the **.shader** file extension.

**Game Files**
- [SHADER - Godot Engine Shader File](/game/shader-godot/)
- [SHADER - Quake 3 Engine Shader File](/game/shader-quake/)
- [SHADER - Unity Shader Asset](/game/shader-unity/)
