## What is an RPD file?

RPD file format is specific to the iTWO application suite used for construction planning and engineering. An RPD file is a database file that stores a Progress ObjectStore Database. This database contains all the data for an iTWO planning project, serving as a backend storage format for the application.

In the iTWO context, the RPD file contains structured information related to construction projects, such as project plans, resources, schedules, budgets, and other project-related data. This format allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of project data within the iTWO application suite.

## Relation with iTWO

RPD file is related to iTWO which is a comprehensive construction management and project control software solution developed by RIB Software SE. It is designed to streamline and optimize various aspects of construction projects, including planning, scheduling, cost management, and collaboration. The software aims to improve project efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance overall project management in the construction industry.

iTWO offers a range of features and modules that cover different aspects of construction project management:

- **Project Planning and Scheduling:** iTWO enables users to create and manage project plans, schedules, and timelines. It allows for the visualization of project phases, tasks, and dependencies.

- **Cost Management:** The software helps with cost estimation, budgeting, and tracking expenses throughout the project lifecycle. This can include managing material costs, labor costs, subcontractor expenses, and more.

- **Resource Management:** iTWO facilitates the allocation of resources, such as labor and equipment, to various project tasks. This helps optimize resource utilization and prevent overallocation.

- **Reporting and Analytics:** The software generates reports and provides analytics to help stakeholders monitor project performance, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions.

- **Integration with BIM (Building Information Modeling):** Some versions of iTWO offer integration with BIM technology, allowing for better visualization and coordination of construction projects using 3D models.

## How to create, open, and import RPD files in iTWO?

Creating, opening, and importing RPD files in iTWO involves specific steps within the software's interface. Below are general guidelines based on common practices in construction management software.

### Creating an RPD File:

1. **Open iTWO:** Launch the iTWO application on your computer.
2. **Create a New Project:** Within iTWO, there should be an option to create a new project. This might be accessible from a "File" menu or a dedicated "New Project" button.
3. **Project Setup:** Follow the prompts to set up your new project. This could involve specifying project details, such as project name, location, dates, and other relevant information.
4. **Save Project:** During the project setup process, you'll likely be prompted to save the project. At this point, iTWO might ask you to choose a location to save the project data. This is where the RPD file will be created.

### Opening an RPD File:

1. **Launch iTWO:** Start the iTWO application on your computer.
2. **Open Project:** In the iTWO interface, look for an option to open existing projects. This might be under a "File" menu or a "Recent Projects" section.
3. **Browse for RPD File:** Navigate to the location where your RPD file is saved. Select the RPD file you want to open and proceed.
4. **Project Access:** Once you've selected the RPD file, iTWO will likely load the associated project data, allowing you to start working on the project.

### Importing Data into an RPD File:

1. **Launch iTWO:** Open the iTWO application.
2. **Open or Create a Project:** You can either open an existing project that you want to import data into or create a new project if needed.
3. **Data Import:** Look for an option within iTWO to import data. This might involve importing data from other file formats or sources.
4. **Select Data Source:** Choose the source of the data you want to import. This could be another file format (such as Excel, CSV) or another iTWO project.
5. **Mapping Data:** If necessary, you might need to map the data fields from the source to the appropriate fields in iTWO's RPD format.
6. **Review and Confirm:** Review the imported data and ensure it's correctly aligned with the project's requirements.
7. **Save Changes:** After importing data, make sure to save your changes to the RPD file.
