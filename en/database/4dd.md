## What is a 4DD file?

4DD files are mostly associated with the 4th Dimension by the 4D, Inc. This 4th Dimension item range includes various Windows and Mac OS technologies that may be utilized as standalone elements or as part of a completely functional, Browser, bridge database creation solution. The database fork is as follows: 

* 	The capacity fork is known as 4DR. It contains the real data that a 4D database architecture file refers to, and it can be compressed using the Compress file instruction in 4D Builder or 4D Client.

Many archives are made up entirely of data sets. Opening unfamiliar files (e.g., 4DD) using a basic text writer like Windows Notepad may reveal portions of the information contained in the file. This technique allows the user to set the data of a large number of files, but not in the same way as a tool designed specifically for this purpose would.

## Brief History ##

The company ACI developed a US-based affiliate ACIUS, first directed by Man Kawasaki, as 4th Dimension's market share expanded over the next several years. The title was recently renamed to 4D after 16 years of operation as ACIUS up until 2000. 

Together with the launch of 4th Dimension v3.1 in 1993, 4D Client v1.1, a customer variant of the software, was released.  4D v3.5 became a bridge in 1995 and has now handled both Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh.


## 4DD File Format Specifications ##

The data file includes all of the data that is entered into the records, as well as all of the data that is associated with them. The data file is named after the name you type in the database creation dialogue box, followed by the [4DB](/database/4db/). 

The existing data file is opened as usual when you load a 4D structure file. If you alter the file's name or location, the Open data folder dialogue box allows you to pick or build a new database.
