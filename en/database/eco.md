## What is an ECO file?

The "ECO" file format is associated with the NetManage ECCO (Enterprise Core Objects) application. ECCO was a personal information manager (PIM) and database software that allowed users to organize and manage their data in a flexible and customizable manner. It was popular during the 1990s and early 2000s.

The ECCO database files have the extension ".eco" and contain structured data stored in a proprietary format. The application allowed users to create custom data fields, forms, and views to organize their information efficiently. However, ECCO was eventually discontinued, and support for the application and its file format may have diminished over time.

## NetManage ECCO

NetManage ECCO, also known as ECCO, was a personal information management (PIM) software developed by NetManage Inc. It gained popularity in the 1990s for its innovative approach to organizing data. The software featured an outliner interface, enabling users to create hierarchical outlines to structure their information. ECCO allowed users to define custom data fields, providing flexibility in storing various types of data. Custom forms and views allowed users to design personalized data entry interfaces and display their data in different ways. The application offered advanced searching and sorting capabilities to efficiently manage large datasets. ECCO also supported scripting and automation, empowering users to create macros and perform repetitive tasks. 

However, NetManage discontinued ECCO, and the last official version was released in 1997. As a legacy format, ECCO's file format, with the ".eco" extension, might not be natively supported by modern software, necessitating third-party tools or converters for accessing existing ECCO files.
