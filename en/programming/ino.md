## What is an INO file?

**INO file** is related to **Arduino Sketch** which is a program written for Arduino boards using the **Arduino programming language**. The Arduino programming language is based on Wiring; and it is similar to C/C++. Arduino Sketches are saved with a .ino file extension and are used to control Arduino circuit boards.

## INO File Format - More Information

The Arduino platform, designed for electronic prototyping, empowers developers to craft and deploy programs, referred to as sketches, onto specialized circuit boards; these sketches range from fundamental tasks like illuminating an LED on circuit board to intricate operations such as transmitting data across the internet; the creation of Arduino sketches takes place within **Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**, and these sketches are stored with the .ino file extension.

In the era preceding Arduino 1.0, sketches were saved with a .PDE file extension by the Arduino IDE. Although the IDE still supports the opening of .PDE files, the recommended practice is to save all sketches, including those originally stored as [.PDE](/programming/pde/) files, with the .ino file extension. This shift reflects the evolution of the platform and ensures compatibility with current standards.

## About Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that simplifies prototyping and development of interactive projects; comprising both hardware and software elements, Arduino caters to a diverse user base, from novices to professionals. The core of the platform is the Arduino boards, equipped with digital and analog pins, USB connectivity and various models based on processors like Atmel AVR or ARM.

The Arduino IDE serves as a user-friendly interface for coding, compiling and uploading programs (sketches) to the boards; the programming language, akin to C/C++, is designed for accessibility, abstracting complexities for beginners. Arduino libraries provide pre-written code snippets for tasks ranging from sensor integration to communication protocols, facilitating efficient development.

Arduino shields, additional boards, expand functionalities, offering features like Ethernet connectivity or motor control. The vibrant Arduino community contributes to an extensive knowledge base through forums, tutorials, and collaborative projects; with applications spanning robotics, home automation, art installations and sensor-based systems, Arduino's versatility and simplicity make it a preferred choice for diverse electronic projects.

## How to open INO file?

**Arduino Integrated Development Environment** can be used to open INO file. But since they are plain text files, any text editor can be used to open or edit its content.
