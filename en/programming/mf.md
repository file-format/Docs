## What is an MF file?

A file with .mf extension is a Java Manifest file that contains information about the individual [JAR](/programming/jar/) file entries. The MF file itself is contained inside the JAR file and provides all the extension and package-related definition. JAR files can be produced to be used as an executable file. In such case, the mainfest file specifies the main class of the application that contains **`public static void main`** statement. Manifest files are named as MANIFEST.MF and can be opened with any text editor on Windows, MacOS and Linux Operating Systems.

## Manifest File Format Specifications

[Manifest file format specifications](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html) are available by Oracle in their guide for JAR file format. A Manifest file comprises of main sections that are followed by a list of sections for individual JAR file entries. Each section follows some rules and restrictions.

### Main Sections

A main section:

* contains information about security and configuration about the JAR file
* contains information about the application or extension that the JAR file is part of
* defines the main attributes for each individual manifest item

**Note**: No attribute in this section can be named "Name".

### Individual Sections

An individual section defines various attributes for packages or files of a JAR file. Each section must start with an attribute named "Name" whose value must be a relative path to the file, or an absolute URL referencing data outside the archive.
