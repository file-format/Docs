## What is a CAF file?

A .CAF file, in the context of CryENGINE, stands for **"CryENGINE Character Animation File."** CryENGINE is a game engine developed by Crytek, and it is known for its use in creating visually stunning and highly immersive games. **.caf** files are specifically used to store character animations within CryENGINE-powered games.

These animation files contain data about how characters or objects should move, their skeletal animations, keyframes, and various parameters needed for character animations. **.caf** files are typically created using specialized animation software compatible with CryENGINE, and they are then imported into the game engine to bring characters and objects to life with dynamic movements and actions.

## CryENGINE

CryENGINE is a powerful and versatile game engine developed by Crytek. It is known for its advanced rendering capabilities, real-time physics simulation, and its ability to create visually stunning and immersive video games. CryENGINE has been used in the development of several successful and graphically impressive game titles.

Here are some key features and aspects of CryENGINE:

1.  **High-Quality Graphics:** CryENGINE is renowned for its cutting-edge graphics capabilities. It supports features like realistic lighting, advanced shaders, dynamic weather systems, and detailed environments, making it a popular choice for creating visually impressive games.
    
2.  **Real-Time Physics:** The engine features a robust physics simulation system that allows for realistic object interactions, including complex character animations, vehicle physics, and destructible environments.
    
3.  **Sandbox Editor:** CryENGINE provides a user-friendly level editor known as the "Sandbox Editor." Game developers can use this tool to design and build game worlds, create terrain, place objects, and script gameplay events.
    
4.  **Multiplatform Support:** CryENGINE is designed to be multiplatform, allowing developers to create games for a variety of platforms, including PC, console (such as PlayStation and Xbox), and even virtual reality (VR) platforms.
    
5.  **AI System:** The engine includes a powerful AI system that developers can use to create intelligent and responsive non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies within their games.
    
6.  **Animation Tools:** CryENGINE offers tools for creating and managing character animations, including the aforementioned .caf animation files.
    
CryENGINE has been used in the development of various popular game titles, including the "Crysis" series, "Far Cry," and "Ryse: Son of Rome," among others.

## File Formats Used by CryENGINE

CryENGINE supports various file formats for different types of game assets and data. Here are some common file formats associated with CryENGINE:

1.  **3D Model Formats:**
    
    -   .cgf: CryENGINE Geometry Format for 3D models.
    -   .chr: Character model format used for characters and NPCs.
    -   .cga: Animation file format for character animations.
    -   .chrparams: Character parameters file for configuring character properties.
    -   .skin: Skin file for character models.
2.  **Texture Formats:**
    
    -   [.dds](/image/dds/): DirectDraw Surface texture format, commonly used for textures in CryENGINE.
    -   [.tif](/image/tiff/): Tagged Image File Format for textures and images.
3.  **Terrain Formats:**
    
    -   .ter: Terrain file format for heightmaps and terrain data.
    -   [.tif](/image/tiff/) (for heightmaps): CryENGINE supports TIFF images for heightmap data.
4.  **Audio Formats:**
    
    -   [.ogg](/audio/ogg/): Ogg Vorbis audio format, commonly used for sound effects and music.
    -   [.wav](/audio/wav/): Waveform Audio File Format, another common audio format used in games.
5.  **Animation Formats:**
    
    -   [.caf](/database/caf/): CryENGINE Character Animation File for character animations.
    -   .cga: Another animation format for character animations.
    -   .anim: Animation data file.
6.  **Database and Configuration Formats:**
    
    -   .dba: Database file for storing structured game data.
    -   [.xml](/web/xml/): Extensible Markup Language file used for configuration and data.
    -   .cryproject: Project configuration file for managing CryENGINE projects.

    -   .mtl: Material file specifying material properties.
    -   .shader: Shader file for defining shader programs.
    -   .xml (for material and shader parameters): XML files are often used for specifying material and shader parameters.
8.  **Level and Map Formats:**
    
    -   .cry: CryENGINE Level file, used for defining game levels and maps.
    -   .cryproj: CryENGINE Project file for managing projects and levels.
9.  **Particle Effects Formats:**
    
    -   .prt: Particle effect file used for creating visual effects.
    -   .dpa: Particle animation file for particle effects.
10. **Script and Code Formats:**
    
    -   [.lua](/programming/lua/): Lua scripting files for game scripting.
    -   [.cpp](/programming/cpp/), [.h](/programming/h/): C++ source code files for custom game logic and plugins.
