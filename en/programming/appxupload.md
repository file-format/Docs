## What is an APPXUPLOAD file?

An APPXUPLOAD file is a single package file that contains multiple app packages or app bundle for uploading to Microsoft Store. It is generated automatically by [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) when developers package their app for publishing to the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps). In addition to an [APPX](/programming/appx/) file, the APPXUPLOAD file contains a symbol file that analyzes app performance after it is published to the Microsoft Store.
