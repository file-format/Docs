## What is an ADDIN file format?

A file with .addin extension is an Add-in definition file created by Microsoft Visual Studio for add-in projects. It is used for registering new add-ins in the Add-In manager of Visual Studio IDE so that these can be used in other projects without re-creation. Add-ins itself are small software applications that extend the functionality of bigger programs by getting to the primary programs. Addin files are stored in [XML](/web/xml/) file format at the same location where the add-in project is created.

## ADDIN File Format - More Information

ADDIN files are saved to disc in XML file format that is human readable. It can be opened in popular text editors including Notepad, Notepad++, Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, and many others. Microsoft has defined the [XML manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/add-in-manifests?tabs=tabid-1) of an Office Add-in that describes how an add-in should be activated after it is been installed and used with Office documents and applications.
