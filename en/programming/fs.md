## What is an FS file?

The **".fs" file extension** is associated with **Visual F#**, programming language developed by Microsoft as part of .NET framework. F# is functional-first programming language that is part of Microsoft .NET ecosystem, and it is designed to be used for variety of application types, including web, desktop and cloud applications.

Visual F# Source Files (with ".fs" extension) contain source code written in **F# programming language**. These files can include functions, modules, types and other F# language constructs. Visual Studio is common development environment for F# programming, providing tools for editing, compiling and debugging F# code.

Programmers use ".fs" files to write F# code and these files are then compiled into executable files ([.EXE](/executable/exe/)) or libraries, typically with [.DLL](/system/dll/) extension. The F# language is known for its concise syntax, immutability by default and strong support for functional programming concepts.
