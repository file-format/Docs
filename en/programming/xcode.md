## What is an XCODE file?

XCODE file format is the primary file for an Xcode project. It contains references to all the project settings, configurations, and source code files. Xcode projects can include one or more targets, such as an app target, test target, or other custom targets. XCODE files are uncommon because by default Xcode saves projects as .XCODEPROJ files.
