## What is an XLAM file? ##

XLAM is an Macro-Enabled Add-In file that is used to add new functions to spreadsheets. An Add-In is a supplemental program that runs additional code and provides additional functionality for spreadsheets. XLAM files are stored with the .xlam extension. XLAM files are XML-based files similar to [XLSM](/spreadsheet/xlsm/) and [XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/) file formats and are saved with ZIP compression to reduce the overall file size.

### Example ###

```cmd
Public Function Add(num1 As Double, num2 As Double)
Add = num1 + num2
End Function
```

After this, save the file with the .xlam extension.
