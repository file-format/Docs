## What is an FP file?

A file with .fp extension is a spreadsheet file created with [FileMaker Pro](https://www.claris.com/filemaker/) software by Claris. It stores data in a rows and columns similar to Microsoft Excel. FileMaker Pro lets you drag and drop a number of file types such as CSV and XML to import their data.

## FP File Format

FP files are saved in proprietary file format and their file format details are not available for public reference. However, there are certain APIs available that uses the FileMaker Pro platform for carrying out different conversions such as the [fmapi](https://github.com/stevenwhitespacesystems/fm-xml2json) that converts [XML](/web/xml/) to [JSON](/web/json/).
