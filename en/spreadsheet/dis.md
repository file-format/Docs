## What is a DIS file?

A DIS file is a workbook file created with [Oracle Discoverer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E28389_01/bi.1111/b40107/overview.htm) software that comprises of several tools for querying, reporting, and data analysis for the Oracle Database. It contains multiple worksheets when data is exported from Oracle Discoverer. Oracle markets Discoverer as a Business Intelligence (BI) product used for for reporting and analysis that works in part of the [Oracle Fusion Middleware](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E28280_01/bi.1111/b40108/toc.htm) suite. Oracle Discoverer doesn't save the reporting data in DIS file format by default.

## How to download Discoverer Workbooks in DIS Format?

Oracle Discoverer Workbooks are stored in the database in binary format and cannot be downloaded as [DIS files](https://forums.oracle.com/ords/apexds/post/can-i-download-all-discoverer-workbooks-to-my-computer-4127) directly. However, data can be exported as EEX files, open it in Discoverer Desktop, and use the Save As option to save the EEX files as DIS files.

## DIS File Format - More Information

DIS files are saved to disc as binary files but their internal file format details are not available for developer's reference.
