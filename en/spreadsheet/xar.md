## What is an XAR file?

A file with .xar extension is a Microsoft Excel Recvoery file that is generated alongside the main Excel spreadsheet files. It is used as a recovery file if the application malfunctions or closes unexpectedly, resulting in loss of data of main file. These recovery files are saved in the same original file format for speed and simplicity. Excel suggests the original file format and name upon reopening the recovered file which it stores in system registry for recovery.

## XAR File Format

The XAR files are recovery files saved in binary file format to disc alongside the main excel file. These are stored as hidden files on disc with arbitrary names, linking to the main excel file from system registry. All open files are actively and periodically saved to the default extension as hidden XAR files and these are saved to discs with names such as ~ar8EF9.xar.

## How to Recover Excel File from XAR file?

XAR files can save all type of Excel file formats such as XLS, XLSX and others. If your Excel Spreadsheet file closes unexpectedly, you can open Excel or double-click your file and it will automatically ask you to recover from the saved recovery file which you can save with the same file name as original for lateral use.
