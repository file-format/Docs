## What is a PSX BIOS?

The **PSX BIOS** is Basic Input/Output System for original **Sony PlayStation console**. It is a set of low-level programs that control hardware of PlayStation and provide essential functions for console to operate. The BIOS is responsible for initializing and managing system components such as CPU, memory, graphics, and input/output devices.

## PSX BIOS - More Information

The PlayStation (PSX) BIOS, officially known as **SCPH-1001**, is a crucial component of original Sony PlayStation console. Here are some key points about PSX BIOS:

1.  **Functionality**:

    The PSX BIOS is a set of low-level programs stored on a read-only memory (ROM) chip within PlayStation hardware. Its primary function is to initialize and control essential hardware components of console such as CPU, memory, graphics processing unit (GPU) and input/output devices.
    
2.  **Boot Process**:

     When you turn on a PlayStation console, the BIOS is first piece of software that gets executed. It performs a series of checks and initializes hardware to prepare system for loading and running game software.
    
3.  **Copyright Protection**:

    The PSX BIOS includes copyright protection mechanisms that were designed to prevent unauthorized copies of games from running on console. These protections include region locking, which means that games from one region may not work on a console from a different region.
    
4.  **Legal Status**:

    The PSX BIOS is proprietary software owned by Sony Computer Entertainment. Its distribution or use without proper authorization is illegal. Users are typically required to use BIOS that comes with their own PlayStation console and are not allowed to distribute or download it separately.
    
5.  **Emulation**:

    In context of emulators, which allow users to play PlayStation games on a computer, obtaining and using PSX BIOS can be a legal gray area. Some emulators require users to provide their own BIOS, extracted from their personal PlayStation console. However, sharing or downloading BIOS from internet without permission is against the law.
    
6.  **BIOS Files**:

    The PSX BIOS file is usually named **"SCPH1001.BIN"** or a similar variant. It is a binary file containing machine code necessary for the BIOS functions.
