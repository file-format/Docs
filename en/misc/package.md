## What is a PACKAGE file?

A **PACKAGE file** is used with the FOREVER Artisan software, which is a tool for digital scrapbooking. This file contains various resources for creating scrapbook pages, such as:

-   **Page templates**: Pre-designed layouts for scrapbook pages.
-   **Cards**: Decorative cards that can be added to the scrapbook.
-   **Seasonal decorations**: Themed elements related to different seasons or holidays.
-   **Creative splatters**: Artistic elements to enhance the design.

To use these resources, you usually buy and download them from the FOREVER online store, then import them into the Artisan software.

In addition to PACKAGE files, digital art kits can also be saved in **SBKIT** or **PAKIT** formats. To import a kit into Artisan, you select "Import content" from the Home menu in the software.
