## What is a FILE file?

A .file file is a generic file and does not related to any specific format. Different softwares that do not recognize the file format of particular file append .file extension. For example, If a browser encounters a file type it doesn't recognize, it might prompt the user to choose an application to open the file or save it with a generic name. In some cases, the absence of a recognizable extension might lead to confusion, but it is not common for browsers or operating systems to automatically append a ".file" extension

## How to open .FILE file?

If you know the format of the .file file, you can change its extension to specific format and open it in the related software. For example, if the internal file format of .file is docx file format, then changing the .file extension to .docx will enable you to open the file in Microsoft Word.

Similarly, if the .file extension internal format is pdf format, then changing the .file to .pdf will let you open the file in Adobe Reader.
