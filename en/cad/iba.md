## What is an IBA file?

IBA file extension is created by Lectra. This file format is also referred as Lectra Clothing Design Pieces file and falls under the category of CAD files. However, the primary file format used by Lectra Modaris is the MDL file format, which is a proprietary format developed by Lectra. MDL files contain information about the 2D and 3D patterns, markers, and models that are created and edited within the Modaris software.

## Relation with Lectra Modaris

IBA is a cad file related to Lectra Modaris software. Lectra Modaris is a 2D and 3D pattern making software developed by Lectra, a technology company specializing in software, hardware, and services for the fashion industry. Lectra Modaris is designed to help fashion designers, pattern makers, and manufacturers create and develop patterns more efficiently and accurately, with features such as pattern grading, marker making, and virtual prototyping. it primarily uses CAD (Computer-Aided Design) files in the following formats:

1. Lectra's own proprietary file format, which has a .mdl extension. This format is used to save patterns, markers, and models created within the Modaris software.
2. DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) file format, which is widely used in the CAD industry to exchange data between different software applications. The DXF format is useful for exporting 2D pattern pieces from Modaris.
3. AAMA (American Apparel Manufacturers Association) file format, which is a standard format for pattern files used in the fashion industry. Modaris can export patterns in AAMA format for use in other software applications.

It is worth noting that Modaris also supports several other file formats, including Gerber (ZIP), Lectra (MOD), Lectra (CIT), and Lectra (LAY). However, these file formats are less commonly used in the fashion industry.
