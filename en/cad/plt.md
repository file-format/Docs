## What is a PLT file?

The PLT file format is a vector-based plotter file introduced by Autodesk, Inc. and contains information for a certain [CAD](/cad/) file. Plotting details require accuracy and precision in production, and usage of PLT file guarantee this as all images are printed using lines instead of dots. The format is based on the HPGL file format which is used for sending information to plotter printers. PLT files can be viewed with its original applications i.e. Autodesk's AutoCAD, but there are other applications as well that can be used to manipulate these files such as CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. A number of applications and APIs support conversion of PLT file format to [DXF](/cad/dxf/), [PDF](/pdf/), [JPEG](/image/jpeg/), [TIFF](/image/tiff/), [PNG](/image/png/), [BMP](/image/bmp/), [CGM](/page-description-language/cgm/), [SVG](/page-description-language/svg/), [PS](/page-description-language/ps/) and [PCL](/page-description-language/pcl/).
