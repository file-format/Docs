## What is an ART file?

An ART file is a CAD model created using the (now discontinued) Autodesk ArtCAM software. It contains 2D or 3D model of a design along with the instructions for a CNC (computer numerical control) machine. The CNC machine uses the ART file to cut the design from different type of materials such as woodworks, engraving, and ornaments. Autodesk ArtCAM was discontinued as of July 7, 2018 and there was no plan made available about any future releases or updates.

## ART File Format

ART files were saved to disc as binary files with no ART file format specifications available for developer's reference. The legacy Delcam ArtCAM product files required a USB security-protection dongle that is relied on while saving the file. This resulted in the legacy .art files being not loaded by the new versions of ArtCAM later on. The lateral Autodesk ArtCAM product ranges don't utilize the USB security-protection dongle.
