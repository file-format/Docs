## What is an RFT file?
RFT file is a typical file which is combined with another file format called RVT to form a Revit project. Revit software is referred to as a Building Infrastructure Modeling (BIM) program that integrates 3D objects in projects created by users with this application. Since the RFT is a template file, it may contain several 3D models, layouts and designs for the users to choose when they start a new Revit project. RFT files usually can't be modified. However, you can save a Revit project as RFT to create your own customized template.


## RFT File Format
RFT files are family template files that can either be loaded (along with RFA files) into a project or saved externally while standard Revit family files are saved with .rfa extension. The RFT or family template files store data comprised of 3D images and other graphical elements; used to start a new family from scratch and family files are particularly used to exchange families between projects.
