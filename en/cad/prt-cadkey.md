## What is a PRT file?

A **.PRT** file typically refers to **CADKEY Part File**, which is file format associated with **CADKEY**, computer-aided design (CAD) software that was widely used in past. CADKEY was developed by CADKEY Corporation, and it was primarily used for 2D and 3D design and drafting.

The ".prt" file extension is used to store individual part or component designs created using CADKEY. These part files can contain 2D sketches, 3D models, dimensions, and other design data specific to particular component of larger assembly.

## CADKEY

CADKEY was popular computer-aided design (CAD) software application used for 2D and 3D design and drafting. It was initially developed by Micro Engineering Solutions, Inc. (Micro Engineering, Inc.), which later became CADKEY Corporation. Here are some key points about CADKEY:

1.  **History:** CADKEY was first released in 1980s and gained popularity as cost-effective and user-friendly CAD software.
    
2.  **Features:** CADKEY offered wide range of features for creating and editing 2D drawings and 3D models. Users could design parts, assemblies, and mechanical components, and it included tools for dimensioning, rendering, and documentation.
    
3.  **Ease of Use:** CADKEY was known for its relatively straightforward user interface, making it accessible to wide range of users, including engineers, architects, and designers.
    
4.  **File Format:** CADKEY used its own proprietary file format, including ".prt" files for part designs and ".asm" files for assemblies. These files could be shared and edited within CADKEY software.
    
5.  **Industry Usage:** CADKEY found usage in various industries, including automotive, manufacturing, and architecture.
