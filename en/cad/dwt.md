## What is a DWT file?

A DWT file is an [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/) drawing template file that is used as starter for creating drawings that can be saved as [DWG](/cad/dwg/) files. Such template files provide initial settings such as unit types, precision required, title blocks, layer names, line types and other similar information for lateral conversion to proper drawing files. Both AutoCAD and CoreCAD can be used to read the template files and utilize them further. In simple words, a DWT is a DWG with pre-defined read-only attributes in the same way as a MSWord [DOT](/word-processing/dot/) file is to a [DOC](/word-processing/doc/) file.

## DWT File Format

DWT can be considered a DWG with predefined values that can be readily used. DWG has been one of the widely used file format by a range of applications and has a robust file structure. Since DWG is a binary file format, it is not human-readable like the plain ASCII [DXF](/cad/dxf/) file format. DWG files usually include information about the image coordinates and any metadata associated with it.
